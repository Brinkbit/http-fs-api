# Overview

This API is intended to be the standard for communication between the client and server for the filesystem component of the Brinkbit IDE.
While our use case is specific, we hope to develop this as a generalized implementation-agnostic standard for managing remote file systems via HTTP requests.

The http-fs-api follows the [RESTful API](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) systems architecture style.
What this means in practice is that all actions are mapped to four [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) which in turn represent the four [CRUD commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
The requested url contains a uri component which determines what resource will be manipulated.

While the API is designed to handle paths, directories, and files as though the backend were an actual file system, it's important to note that your backend implementation does not need to be an actual filesystem.
In fact, we recommend that you not store the manipulated resources on an actual filesystem but use some other form of data storage i.e. a database or S3 Buckets.

All examples contained in this document are written as HTTP requests, with the fictitious `http://animals.com` as the domain.
In all the examples, `pets/` will be the route on which the file system API is defined.
The structure of the file system is as follows:

TODO: replace with graphic.

+ pets/
  + cats/
    + siamese.jpg
    + cat_adjectives.txt
    + kindof_pretty_cat.png
    + very_pretty_cat.gif
    + cat_names.txt
    + more_pretty_cats/
  + dogs/
    + golden_retriever.bmp
    + loyal_companion.png

# Resources

Our filesystem has two types of resources, files and directories.
Both can be manipulated with the same actions, but each behave a little differently.

Files are discrete, independent resources, containing metadata specifically to itself and their own data.
Files must live either at the top level of the file system, or within a directory.

Directories are containers for files and other directories, containing metadata for itself, as well as aggregated data concerning it's contents. They are denoted by a trailing slash, following their name, e.g., "more_pretty_cats/"

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

# Request

Requests are made on a uri with one of the following four [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html): "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE".

A uri represents the resource to take action on.
For example the uri `/cats/siamese.jpg`

A JSON object MUST be at the root of every JSON API request containing data.
This object defines a document's "top level".
Every request containing a JSON object MUST have a `data` field at the top level

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    //...
  }
}
```

A request MAY specify an `action` string field within the `data` field.
If no action is specified, then the associated default behavior occurs.
Each `action` field has a set of accepted parameters, and the API MUST return a 400 status if a mismatch occurs.
Note that each method's default has it's own alias, for consistency.

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "action": "move",
    //...
  }
}
```

The request MAY have a `parameters` field with the `data` field, which contains specific parameters for the given `action`. If there is no `action` field, the entire `parameters` field is ignored.

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "action": "move",
    "parameters": {
      "destination": "dogs/",
      //...
    }
  }
}
```

The `parameters` field MAY also contain a `flags` field,
which is an array of strings representing aliased flags which alter the specified action.
The current list of flags are:

`force` / `f`: force operation

`recursive` / `r`: recursive

`unique` / `u`: force uniqueness.

Finishing out the example, to move the `siamese.jpg` resource from the `/cats/` directory to the `/dogs/` directory, overwriting any resource there that shares the name, you would send the following request:

```http
PUT /cats/siamese.jpg HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/fs.api+json
Accept: application/fs.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "action": "move",
    "parameters": {
      "destination": "dogs/",
      "flags": [ "force" ]
    },
  }
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

# Response

Similar to the request syntax, most responses SHOULD have a JSON object at the root of the response when it contains data, which defines the response's "top level".
The only exceptions to this are the successful `read` and `download` responses, which MUST only contain the resource's data.
Every other response MUST have a `data` field at the top level on success, or an `errors` field on failure.
It MUST NOT have both.
The root level response MAY contain a metadata field that contains relevant or more descriptive data.
The root level of a JSON response MUST NOT contain any fields besides `data`, `error`, and `metadata`.

A successful response will have all relevant data inside of a top-level `data` array, e.g.:
```javascript
{
  "data": [
    "file1",
    "file2",
    "folder/"
  ]
}
```

An error response WILL have a JSON object at the root, and WILL have an `errors` field at the top level.
The `errors` field isan array of at least one JSON object containing only a  `status` field and `message` field. The `status` field should be a numerical status code representing the error condition, and the 'message' field should be a human-readable string giving additional information. E.g.:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": 404,
      "message": "File not found."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Actions

`action` is an optional parameter under `data` which gives direction for what operation will take place on the specified resource, or set of resources.
Each action has an associated [HTTP method](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html), and only the actions associated with that HTTP method are accepted.
If a mismatch between HTTP method and action occurs, the API MUST return a 400 status.
The list of actions per method are as follows:

- [GET](#get): [`read`](#1.1), [`search`](#1.2), [`inspect`](#1.3), [`download`](#1.4)
- [POST](#post): [`create`](#2.1), [`bulk`](#2.2), [`copy`](#2.3)

- [DELETE](#delete): [`delete`](#4.1)
